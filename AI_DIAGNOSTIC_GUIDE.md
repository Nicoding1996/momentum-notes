# Chrome AI Diagnostic Guide - Final Solution

## What We've Implemented

Based on your previous project's successful fix, I've added a **Diagnostic Probe** tool that will give us the exact error message from Chrome.

## How to Use the Diagnostic Probe

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Open any note** to see the editor
3. Look for the status bar that says "AI tools unavailable"
4. **Click the "Run Probe" button** (amber/orange colored)
5. **Read the alert message** that appears

This probe will attempt to create actual AI sessions and report the exact success/failure for each API.

## What the Probe Results Mean

### ✅ Success Messages
If you see:
```
✅ Language Model: session created successfully
✅ Writer API: session created successfully
✅ Summarizer API: session created successfully
```

**This means the AI is actually working!** The issue is just with the `capabilities()` check. I'll then update the code to bypass that unreliable check.

### ❌ Error Messages - Common Cases

#### "Model not available"
**Cause**: The Gemini Nano model needs to be initialized
**Solution**: 
1. Visit any webpage
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for Chrome to initialize the model in background
3. Run the probe again

#### "Not allowed by permissions policy" or "Feature not enabled"
**Cause**: Flags aren't fully activated
**Solution**:
1. Go to `chrome://flags/` and search for "gemini"
2. Enable ALL Gemini-related flags
3. **Close Chrome completely** (not just the tab)
4. **Reopen Chrome**
5. **Close Chrome again**
6. **Reopen Chrome** (double restart is crucial!)

#### "Session creation failed" or "Create is not a function"
**Cause**: Using wrong API surface for your Chrome build
**Solution**: The probe will tell us which API surface works, and I'll update the code

## Based on Your Console Logs

From your screenshots, I noticed:
- `hasLegacyLanguageModel: true` ✅
- But `languageModelCaps: {available: 'no'}` ❌

This suggests Chrome has the API but is blocking session creation. The probe will reveal why.

## Next Steps After Running Probe

### Scenario 1: Probe Shows Success
If the probe creates sessions successfully, it means `capabilities()` is lying. I'll update the code to:
1. Skip the capabilities check
2. Try creating sessions directly
3. Fall back gracefully if it fails

### Scenario 2: Probe Shows Specific Error
If the probe shows an error like "Model not ready" or "Permissions denied", we'll:
1. Follow the exact fix for that error
2. Update the code if needed
3. Re-run the probe to confirm

### Scenario 3: Chrome Dev Build Issue
If the probe consistently fails on Chrome Dev but your flags are enabled and model is downloaded, we'll:
1. Try Chrome Canary instead
2. Or implement a fallback to use the `window.LanguageModel` API directly

## The Key Insight from Your Previous Fix

You mentioned this was solved in your previous project by:
1. Checking multiple API surfaces (`window.ai.languageModel`, `window.ai.prompt`, `window.LanguageModel`)
2. Trying each one in order until one works
3. Using a diagnostic tool to get the real error

I've implemented exactly that approach here. The probe will tell us which path to take.
