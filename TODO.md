# Hackathon Polish: Prioritized Task List

This document outlines the critical tasks to focus on for the hackathon submission, prioritizing core functionality and user experience.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Highest Priority)

- [ ] **Implement Basic Note-Taking:**
    - [ ] Create a new note and save it to IndexedDB.
    - [ ] Edit an existing note and update it in IndexedDB.
    - [ ] Delete a note from IndexedDB.
    - [ ] Ensure the UI correctly reflects these changes in real-time.

## Phase 2: Solidify Offline-First Experience

- [ ] **Complete PWA Implementation:**
    - [ ] Generate a comprehensive set of PWA icons (e.g., 192x192, 512x512) and add them to the `public` directory.
    - [ ] Update the `manifest` in `vite.config.ts` to include the new icons.
    - [ ] Rigorously test the service worker's caching behavior to ensure all necessary assets are available offline.

- [ ] **Test Data Persistence:**
    - [ ] Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes while offline.
    - [ ] Go back online and verify that all changes are correctly persisted without data loss.
    - [ ] Test edge cases, such as closing the app abruptly while offline.

## Phase 3: Refine User Experience (UX)

- [ ] **Enhance Canvas Interaction:**
    - [ ] Profile and optimize drag-and-drop performance.
    - [ ] Ensure zoom and pan controls are smooth, especially with a large number of notes.
    - [ ] Implement visual feedback for interactions (e.g., highlighting a note on drag).

- [ ] **Streamline AI Integration Flow:**
    - [ ] Add loading indicators or skeletons when AI actions (expand, summarize) are in progress.
    - [ ] Implement clear and non-intrusive notifications for AI success or failure.
    - [ ] Ensure the UI remains responsive during AI processing.

- [ ] **Performance Testing:**
    - [ ] Create a test script to populate IndexedDB with a large number of notes (e.g., 500+).
    - [ ] Test UI responsiveness and AI action speed with the large dataset.
    - [ ] Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
