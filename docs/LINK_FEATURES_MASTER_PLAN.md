# Link & Autolink Features - Master Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the implementation of three major linking improvements in Synapse Notes:

1. **Wikilink Syntax** (`[[Note Title]]`) - Inline text-based linking
2. **Backlinks Panel** - Bidirectional link awareness
3. **AI Link Suggestions** - Proactive, intelligent connection building

These features transform linking from a manual canvas-only operation into a seamless, AI-assisted workflow that happens naturally while writing.
