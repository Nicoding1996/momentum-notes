## 🎨 Color System

### Predefined Color Palette (10 Colors)

Inspired by Notion's color system, a 10-color palette was implemented, each with light/dark mode variants.

### Color Picker UI

A color picker was added to the note header, allowing users to select a color from the palette and apply it to the note with a smooth transition.

---

## ✏️ Formatting Toolbar

A formatting toolbar was implemented that appears when a note is in edit mode and is large enough to accommodate it.

**Features:**
- Text formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough)
- Heading levels (H1, H2, H3)
- Lists (bullet and numbered)
- "Done" button to exit edit mode

---

## 📐 Resize Handle Redesign

The resize handles were redesigned to be larger, always visible, and more accessible, with improved visual feedback on hover and drag.

---

## 🎭 Visual States

A clear visual distinction between different note states was implemented:
- **Default (View Mode)**
- **Editing Mode**
- **Selected**
- **Dragging**

---

## 💾 Database Schema Changes

The `Note` interface was updated to include a `color` field, and a database migration was implemented to add this field to existing notes.

---

## 🎮 Interaction Patterns

- **Editing Flow**: A smooth flow for entering and exiting edit mode was implemented, with clear visual cues.
- **Color Change Flow**: A simple and intuitive flow for changing a note's color was implemented.
- **Resize Flow**: A responsive and visually clear flow for resizing notes was implemented.

---

## ♿ Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard navigation was implemented for notes, the color picker, and the formatting toolbar.
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels and roles were used to ensure all new UI elements are accessible.
- **Touch Accessibility**: All interactive elements have a minimum 44x44px touch target.
- **Color Contrast**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards.

---

## 🏗️ Component Architecture

The following new components were created:
- `NoteColorPicker.tsx`
- `CanvasFormattingToolbar.tsx`
- `EnhancedResizeHandles.tsx`

The `NoteNode` component in `CanvasView.tsx` was updated to integrate these new components and features.
