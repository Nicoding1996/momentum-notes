# Linking System Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the linking system to simplify the user experience while maintaining the power of relationship types.

## Problem Statement

The original system had three overlapping linking methods, which caused user confusion and friction.

## Solution: Simplified Hybrid Approach

### Key Changes

- **Removed Relationship Type Modal for Manual Links**: Connections are now created instantly with a default "related-to" type.
- **Added Right-Click Context Menu**: Users can right-click any connection to change its type or delete it.
- **Wikilinks Always Use "references" Type**: `[[links]]` are now consistently treated as references.
- **Improved AI Auto-Link Button**: The button was renamed to "Discover Connections" to better describe its function.
- **Toast Notifications**: A toast notification now appears after creating a connection, teaching users about the new right-click context menu.

## Technical Implementation

- **`src/components/CanvasView.tsx`**: Updated to handle the new connection creation flow, the right-click context menu, and the toast notifications.
- **`src/components/ui/EdgeContextMenu.tsx`**: A new component that displays the context menu for changing relationship types.
- **`src/lib/wikilink-sync.ts`**: The existing logic for handling wikilinks was confirmed to correctly use the "references" type.

## User Experience Flow

- **Manual Connections**: Users can now drag and drop to create connections instantly, with an optional right-click to change the relationship type.
- **Wikilinks**: Typing `[[Note Title]]` creates a "references" link.
- **AI Discovery**: Clicking "Discover Connections" automatically creates connections with appropriate relationship types.

## Benefits Summary

- **For All Users**: Faster linking, less cognitive load, and a more natural workflow.
- **For Power Users**: Full control over relationship types via the context menu.
- **For AI Users**: Smart suggestions with a clear review and modification workflow.

## Future Enhancements

- Keyboard shortcuts for the context menu.
- Bulk type changes for multiple selected edges.
- Visual edge weights to represent relationship strength.
