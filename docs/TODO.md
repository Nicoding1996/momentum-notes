# Project Task List

This document outlines the critical tasks completed and areas for future improvement.

## Core Functionality (Completed)

- [x] **Implement Basic Note-Taking:**
    - [x] Create a new note and save it to IndexedDB.
    - [x] Edit an existing note and update it in IndexedDB.
    - [x] Delete a note from IndexedDB.
    - [x] Ensure the UI correctly reflects these changes in real-time.

## Offline-First Experience (Completed)

- [x] **Complete PWA Implementation:**
    - [x] Generate a comprehensive set of PWA icons (e.g., 192x192, 512x512) and add them to the `public` directory.
    - [x] Update the `manifest` in `vite.config.ts` to include the new icons.
    - [x] Rigorously test the service worker's caching behavior to ensure all necessary assets are available offline.

- [x] **Test Data Persistence:**
    - [x] Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes while offline.
    - [x] Go back online and verify that all changes are correctly persisted without data loss.
    - [x] Test edge cases, such as closing the app abruptly while offline.

## User Experience (UX) Refinements (Completed)

- [x] **Enhance Canvas Interaction:**
    - [x] Profile and optimize drag-and-drop performance.
    - [x] Ensure zoom and pan controls are smooth, especially with a large number of notes.
    - [x] Implement visual feedback for interactions (e.g., highlighting a note on drag).

- [x] **Streamline AI Integration Flow:**
    - [x] Add loading indicators or skeletons when AI actions (expand, summarize) are in progress.
    - [x] Implement clear and non-intrusive notifications for AI success or failure.
    - [x] Ensure the UI remains responsive during AI processing.

- [x] **Performance Testing:**
    - [x] Create a test script to populate IndexedDB with a large number of notes (e.g., 500+).
    - [x] Test UI responsiveness and AI action speed with the large dataset.
    - [x] Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
