# AI Chat Conversation Memory

## Problem Identified

When users had a conversation like this:
```
User: "tell me about importance of strength exercise"
AI: [provides detailed notes about strength exercise]
User: "please add it in my notes"
```

The AI would try to add the user's message "please add it in my notes" instead of its own previous response about strength exercise. This happened because the AI had no memory of the conversation.

## Solution: Conversation History Context

The system now maintains conversation context by including the last 3 messages in every prompt sent to the AI.

### Implementation

```typescript
// Build conversation history (last 3 messages for context)
const recentMessages = messages.slice(-3)
let conversationHistory = ''
if (recentMessages.length > 0) {
  conversationHistory = '\n\nRecent Conversation:\n'
  recentMessages.forEach(msg => {
    const role = msg.role === 'user' ? 'USER' : 'ASSISTANT'
    conversationHistory += `${role}: ${msg.content}\n`
  })
}
```

### Enhanced Prompt Structure

The AI now receives:
```
Note Title: "..."
Note Content: [existing content]

Recent Conversation:
ASSISTANT: Here are notes on the Importance of Strength Exercise...
USER: please add it in my notes

Current User Request: please add it in my notes

---
TASK: Analyze the user's request (considering the conversation history)...
IMPORTANT CONTEXT RULES:
- If user says "add it" or "insert that" or uses pronouns, use content from recent conversation
- If user asks for new content, generate new content
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Follow-up with Pronouns
```
User: "give me notes on hydration"
AI: [provides hydration notes]
User: "add it to my note"
```
**Result:** AI detects INTENT:ADD and adds the hydration notes it just provided (not the user's command)

### Scenario 2: New Request
```
User: "give me notes on hydration"
AI: [provides hydration notes]
User: "now give me notes on exercise"
```
**Result:** AI generates new exercise notes (recognizes this is a new request, not a follow-up)

### Scenario 3: Clarification
```
User: "make this better"
AI: [provides improved version]
User: "actually, make it more casual instead"
```
**Result:** AI understands the context and adjusts from the original content, not from its first improvement

## Context Rules

The AI follows these rules when processing requests with conversation history:

1. **Pronoun References**: "it", "that", "this", "them"
   - AI looks at recent conversation to identify what the pronoun refers to
   - Most commonly: AI's own previous response

2. **Action Phrases**: "add it", "insert that", "use this"
   - AI uses content from conversation history
   - Detects INTENT:ADD for proper button display

3. **New Requests**: "now give me", "also provide", "create new"
   - AI generates fresh content
   - Ignores previous responses

4. **Modifications**: "make it better", "change that to"
   - AI starts from the referenced content in history
   - Applies the requested transformation

## Technical Details

### Message History Limit
- **Last 3 messages** included in context
- Balance between:
  - ✅ Enough context for pronoun resolution
  - ✅ Not overwhelming the AI with too much text
  - ✅ Keeping prompt size reasonable for fast responses

### Why 3 Messages?
- Message 1: User's original request
- Message 2: AI's response
- Message 3: User's follow-up (current)

This covers most natural conversation patterns.

## Benefits

1. **Natural Conversation**: Users can say "add it" instead of repeating themselves
2. **Pronoun Support**: "it", "that", "this" all work correctly
3. **Follow-up Actions**: "now do X with that" flows naturally
4. **Context-Aware**: AI understands the full conversation arc

## Edge Cases Handled

### Empty History
```typescript
if (recentMessages.length > 0) {
  // Only add history if it exists
}
```

### First Message
- No conversation history available
- Works as expected with just note content

### Long Conversations
- Only last 3 messages included
- Prevents prompt from becoming too long
- Focuses on immediate context

## Performance Impact

**Minimal.** Adding 3 messages to the prompt increases the input by ~100-300 words, which has negligible impact on the on-device AI model's response time.

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Multi-step Addition
```
User: "give me hydration tips"
AI: [INTENT:INFO] Here are hydration tips: ...
User: "add those to my note"
AI: [INTENT:ADD] [returns the hydration tips from previous message]
Buttons: [Copy] [Insert Below]
```

### Workflow 2: Iterative Refinement
```
User: "make this professional"
AI: [INTENT:REPLACE] [professional version]
User: "actually make it casual instead"
AI: [INTENT:REPLACE] [casual version of original, not professional version]
```

### Workflow 3: Clarification Chain
```
User: "summarize this"
AI: [INTENT:REPLACE] [summary]
User: "make it longer"
AI: [INTENT:REPLACE] [expands the summary]
User: "add bullet points"
AI: [INTENT:REPLACE] [formats with bullets]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable History Length**: Let users choose 1-5 messages
2. **Smart History Selection**: Include only relevant messages, not just last N
3. **Explicit References**: "Use your first response" → AI finds it in history
4. **History Summary**: For very long conversations, summarize older messages

## Conclusion

By giving the AI short-term memory of the conversation, we've transformed the chat from a stateless command processor into a natural conversational assistant that understands context and references, making the user experience dramatically more intuitive and efficient.
