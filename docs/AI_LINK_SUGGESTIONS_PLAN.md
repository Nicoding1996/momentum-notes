# AI-Powered Link Suggestions Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of real-time, AI-powered link suggestions that proactively help users build their knowledge graph while writing. This feature leverages the built-in Chrome AI to analyze content and suggest relevant connections.

## Purpose & Benefits

### User Value
- **Proactive**: The system suggests links instead of the user having to search.
- **Contextual**: Suggestions are based on what the user is currently writing.
- **Smart**: The AI understands semantic relationships, not just keywords.
- **Frictionless**: One-click to accept, easy to dismiss.
- **Learning**: Helps discover forgotten connections.

## Architecture

### Triggering Suggestions
A balanced approach was implemented to trigger suggestions:
- **Automatic**: After a 3-second pause in typing.
- **Manual**: Via a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+L).
- **Debouncing**: A minimum of 5 seconds between auto-suggestions prevents interruptions.

### AI Analysis Pipeline
1. **Trigger**: A suggestion is triggered by a pause or manual command.
2. **Context Extraction**: The current paragraph, note title, and tags are extracted.
3. **Candidate Filtering**: The system excludes the current note and already linked notes, and gets the top 20 most relevant notes.
4. **AI Semantic Analysis**: The AI analyzes content similarity and tag overlap to score confidence.
5. **Ranking & Filtering**: Suggestions with a confidence score below 0.7 are filtered out, and the top 2-3 suggestions are displayed.

## Component Implementation

### 1. `useAILinkSuggestions` Hook (`src/hooks/useAILinkSuggestions.ts`)
- Manages the state of suggestions, analysis status, and debouncing.
- Includes a debounced analysis function that extracts context, gets candidate notes, builds an AI prompt, and gets the AI analysis.
- Provides a manual trigger function and a function to clear suggestions.

### 2. `LinkSuggestionPanel` Component (`src/components/LinkSuggestionPanel.tsx`)
- Displays the link suggestions in a floating panel.
- Shows an "Analyzing connections..." state while the AI is working.
- Each suggestion includes the note title, the reason for the suggestion, shared tags, a confidence score, and an "Accept" button.

## Integration with NoteEditor

The `useAILinkSuggestions` hook and `LinkSuggestionPanel` component are integrated into the `NoteEditor`. When a suggestion is accepted, a wikilink is inserted at the cursor's position.

## User Experience Flow

### Auto-Suggestion Flow
When the user pauses typing, the AI analyzes the context in the background and displays a panel with link suggestions. The user can then accept a suggestion to insert a wikilink into their note.

### Manual Trigger Flow
The user can press Ctrl+Shift+L to manually trigger the AI analysis and see link suggestions.

## Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: AI responses are cached for 5 minutes to prevent redundant API calls.
- **Debouncing**: A 3-second typing pause and a 5-second cooldown between analyses prevent excessive API calls.
- **Candidate Filtering**: Limiting the analysis to 20 candidate notes reduces AI processing time.

## Settings & Preferences

User preferences for link suggestions can be configured, including enabling/disabling the feature, setting the trigger mode, and adjusting the minimum confidence score.
