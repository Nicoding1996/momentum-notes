# Backlinks Panel Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a Backlinks Panel in Synapse Notes, which displays all notes that link TO the currently open note. This creates bidirectional awareness and enables users to discover connections they may have forgotten about.

## Purpose & Benefits

### User Value
- **Discovery**: Find related notes you've referenced this note from.
- **Context**: Understand why a note matters by seeing what links to it.
- **Navigation**: Jump between connected notes without using the canvas.
- **Validation**: Confirm that your knowledge graph is well-connected.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
The system queries the `wikilinks` table for all links targeting the current note's ID. For each result, it fetches the source note and extracts a context snippet around the link to display in the panel.

### Component Hierarchy
```
NoteEditor
└── Sidebar
    └── BacklinksPanel (collapsible)
        ├── BacklinkItem (for each linking note)
        └── Empty State (if no backlinks)
```

---

## Component Implementation

### 1. BacklinksPanel Component (`src/components/BacklinksPanel.tsx`)
- Uses `useLiveQuery` from `dexie-react-hooks` to get real-time updates.
- Queries all wikilinks pointing to the current note.
- Fetches source notes and extracts context snippets.
- Displays a list of `BacklinkItem` components or an empty state.

### 2. BacklinkItem Component (`src/components/BacklinkItem.tsx`)
- Displays the source note's title, a context snippet, the relationship type, and a timestamp.
- Clicking the item navigates to the source note.
- Includes hover and focus states for better UX.

## Integration with NoteEditor

The `BacklinksPanel` is integrated into a new sidebar in the `NoteEditor`. This sidebar is always visible on desktop and collapsible on mobile to ensure a responsive experience.

---

## Features & Interactions

- **Click to Navigate**: Clicking a backlink item opens that note in the editor.
- **Hover Effects**: Items highlight on hover, and a navigation arrow appears.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The panel is fully keyboard accessible.
- **Contextual Information**: Each item displays the relationship type, a timestamp, and a context snippet.
- **Performance**: The panel uses live queries for real-time updates and efficient database queries with indexes.

---

## Edge Cases Handled

- **No Backlinks**: A friendly empty state is shown with a hint on how to create links.
- **Broken Links**: If a source note is deleted, the backlink automatically disappears.
- **Multiple References**: Each instance is shown separately with its own context snippet.
- **Long Context**: Snippets are truncated to a reasonable length.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Unlinked Mentions**: Show notes that mention the current note's title but don't have wikilinks.
- **Grouped by Relationship**: Collapsible sections for each relationship type.
- **Inline Editing**: Edit context snippets directly in the panel.
- **Filtering and Searching**: Filter backlinks by type, date, or tags, and search within backlinks.
