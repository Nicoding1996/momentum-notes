### Database
- **[`src/lib/db.ts`](src/lib/db.ts)** - Updated to version 4 with `relationshipType` index

### Components
- **[`src/components/CanvasView.tsx`](src/components/CanvasView.tsx)** - Major enhancements:
  - Relationship type selection modal
  - Color-coded edge rendering
  - Filter dropdown UI
  - Enhanced AI prompts for type suggestions
  - Updated edge creation flow

## üé® Features Implemented

### 1. Predefined Relationship Types

Six semantic relationship types with unique colors:
- **Related to** (Blue #3b82f6) - General relationships
- **Depends on** (Red #ef4444) - Dependencies
- **Part of** (Green #10b981) - Hierarchies
- **Supports** (Orange #f59e0b) - Supporting evidence
- **Contradicts** (Purple #8b5cf6) - Opposing views
- **References** (Cyan #06b6d4) - Citations

### 2. Interactive UI Components

**Relationship Selection Modal:**
- Appears when creating new connections
- Shows all relationship types with descriptions
- Color-coded for easy identification
- Dismissible with X button

**Filter Dropdown:**
- Filter icon in toolbar
- Shows all relationship types
- Real-time filtering
- "All Types" option to show everything

### 3. Visual Enhancements

**Color-Coded Edges:**
- Each relationship type has unique color
- Labels show relationship name
- Smooth, professional appearance
- Maintains consistency across graph

**Filter Indication:**
- Active filter shown in button
- Only matching edges displayed
- Smooth transitions

### 4. AI Intelligence with Tag Integration

**Enhanced Auto-Linking:**
- AI analyzes semantic relationships from content
- **Incorporates note tags as strong signals**
- Suggests appropriate relationship types
- Provides reasoning for each connection
- Returns structured JSON with types
- Prioritizes content while using tags to confirm connections

**How Tags Improve AI:**
- Notes with shared tags are prioritized
- Tags help disambiguate similar topics
- Tag overlap increases connection confidence
- Aligns AI suggestions with user's mental model

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Data Model
```typescript
interface NoteEdge {
  id: string;
  source: string;
  target: string;
  createdAt: string;
  label?: string;
  relationshipType?: string; // NEW
}
```

### Relationship Types
```typescript
export const RELATIONSHIP_TYPES = {
  RELATED_TO: { id: 'related-to', label: 'Related to', color: '#3b82f6', ... },
  DEPENDS_ON: { id: 'depends-on', label: 'Depends on', color: '#ef4444', ... },
  // ... 4 more types
}
```

### Database Version
- **Version 4**: Added `relationshipType` index to edges table
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Automatic migration on app load

## üéØ User Benefits

### For Researchers
- Distinguish between citations, supporting evidence, and contradictions
- Build more structured literature reviews
- Track dependencies between concepts

### For Developers
- Map code dependencies clearly
- Link documentation to implementations
- Track bug fixes and features

### For Students
- Create hierarchical knowledge structures
- Link prerequisites to advanced topics
- Identify supporting vs contradicting information

### For Everyone
- Visual, intuitive knowledge organization
- Reduced cognitive load through filtering
- AI-assisted relationship discovery

## üöÄ Usage Flow

### Manual Connection Creation
1. User drags connection between notes
2. Modal appears with relationship types
3. User selects appropriate type
4. Connection created with color and label

### AI-Assisted Creation
1. User clicks "AI Auto-Link Notes"
2. AI analyzes note contents
3. AI suggests connections with types
4. Connections created automatically
5. User can review and delete if needed

### Filtering
1. User clicks filter button
2. Selects relationship type
3. Graph shows only matching connections
4. Can switch between types anytime

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Database indexed** on `relationshipType` for O(log n) filtering
- **Memoized edge rendering** prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient filtering** using useMemo hooks
- **Smooth animations** with CSS transitions
- **No performance impact** on existing features

## üîß Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Relationship Types
To add a new type, update [`RELATIONSHIP_TYPES`](src/types/edge.ts:9):
```typescript
NEW_TYPE: { 
  id: 'new-type', 
  label: 'New Type', 
  color: '#hexcolor',
  description: 'Description here'
}
```

### Customizing Colors
Edit the `color` field in [`RELATIONSHIP_TYPES`](src/types/edge.ts:9)

### Modifying AI Prompts
Update the prompt in [`handleAutoLink`](src/components/CanvasView.tsx:262) function

## üìù Documentation Created

1. **[`KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_PLAN.md`](KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_PLAN.md)** - Original architectural plan
2. **[`KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_GUIDE.md`](KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_GUIDE.md)** - User guide with examples
3. **[`KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`](KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - This document

## üÜï Latest Enhancement: Tag-Aware AI

After the initial implementation, we added tag integration to the AI auto-linking feature:

### What Changed
- AI now receives note tags alongside title and content
- Prompt instructs AI to use tags as high-confidence signals
- Tags help confirm relationships found in content
- Shared tags increase likelihood of connection

### Benefits
- **Improved Accuracy**: Tags provide clear categorical signals
- **Disambiguation**: Helps AI distinguish between similar topics
- **User-Aligned**: Reflects how users already organize their notes
- **Context-Rich**: Combines content semantics with explicit categorization

### Technical Details
- Fetches all tags from database before AI analysis
- Maps tag IDs to tag names for readable AI prompt
- Tags included in prompt only if notes have them
- AI instructed to prioritize content but confirm with tags
