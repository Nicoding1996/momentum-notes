# Knowledge Graph Implementation Summary

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the implementation of the Knowledge Graph feature in the note-taking application. The goal of this feature was to enhance the existing note connections functionality by introducing explicit relationship types and visualizations. This allows users to create more meaningful and structured connections between their notes, transforming their note collection into a true knowledge graph.

## 2. Data Model

To support relationship types, the `NoteEdge` interface in `src/types/edge.ts` was updated to include a `relationshipType` field. This field is a string that defines the type of relationship between two notes (e.g., "related to", "depends on", "is a part of").

### `src/types/edge.ts`

```typescript
export interface NoteEdge {
  id: string;
  source: string; // Source note ID
  target: string; // Target note ID
  createdAt: string; // ISO date
  label?: string; // Optional label for the connection
  relationshipType?: string; // e.g., "related to", "depends on"
}
```

## 3. UI/UX

The UI/UX was updated to support the new relationship types. The following changes were made:

*   **Connection Creation**: When a user creates a connection between two notes, they are prompted to select a relationship type from a predefined list.
*   **Connection Visualization**: The relationship type is displayed as a label on the connection line. Different relationship types are visualized with different colors.
*   **Connection Filtering**: Users can filter the connections displayed on the canvas based on their relationship type.

## 4. Implementation Details

The implementation of the Knowledge Graph feature involved changes to the following files:

*   **`src/types/edge.ts`**: The `NoteEdge` interface was updated to include the `relationshipType` field.
*   **`src/components/CanvasView.tsx`**: The `CanvasView` component was updated to support the creation, visualization, and filtering of connections with relationship types.
*   **`src/lib/db.ts`**: The database schema was updated to include the `relationshipType` field in the `edges` table.

### `src/components/CanvasView.tsx` Changes

The `handleConnect` function was updated to prompt the user to select a relationship type when a new connection is created. The selected relationship type is saved to the database along with the other connection details.

The component was also updated to render the relationship type as a label on the connection line. This was achieved by using the `label` prop of the `Edge` component from `@xyflow/react`.

Finally, a new UI component was added to allow users to filter the connections displayed on the canvas based on their relationship type. This component updates the `edges` state of the `ReactFlow` component based on the user's selection.

## 5. Future Enhancements

The following are some potential future enhancements for the Knowledge Graph feature:

*   **Custom Relationship Types**: Allow users to define their own custom relationship types.
*   **Relationship Type Colors**: Allow users to assign different colors to different relationship types.
*   **Relationship Type Inference**: Use AI to automatically infer the relationship type between two notes based on their content.
