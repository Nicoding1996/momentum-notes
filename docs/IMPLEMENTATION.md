## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Test Note Editor:
```
1. Create a new note
2. Click on it to open editor
3. Type some text
4. Wait 2 seconds (should see "Saved" timestamp)
5. Press Ctrl+S to manually save
6. Press Esc (should warn about unsaved changes if any)
7. Check word/character count updates
```

### Test Canvas View:
```
1. Create multiple notes
2. Switch to Canvas view (Grid icon)
3. Drag notes to different positions
4. Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
5. Pan by dragging background
6. Check minimap shows all notes
7. Refresh page - positions should persist
```

### Test AI Features:
```
1. Enable Chrome AI in chrome://flags
2. Open a note with some text
3. Select a short phrase
4. Click "Expand" (should expand the text)
5. Click "Summarize" (should add summary)
6. Select poorly written text
7. Click "Improve" (should enhance it)
```

### Test Search:
```
1. Create notes with varied content
2. Click Search icon
3. Type partial words (fuzzy match should work)
4. Try date filters
5. Check search highlighting
6. Click result to open note
```

---

## üìä Performance Notes

- **IndexedDB** provides instant local storage
- **Auto-save** debounced to prevent excessive writes
- **Canvas** uses React Flow's virtual rendering for large note sets
- **Search** uses in-memory fuzzy matching (fast for <1000 notes)
- **AI Processing** happens on-device (no network latency)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Chrome AI** only works in Chrome 128+ with flags enabled
2. **Canvas positions** use absolute coordinates (no relative positioning yet)
3. **Search** doesn't support regex patterns (only fuzzy matching)
4. **No undo/redo** in editor (browser's built-in undo works)
5. **Large notes** (>10MB) may slow down canvas rendering

---

## üí° Tips for Users

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` = Save note
  - `Esc` = Close editor/search
  
- **Canvas Best Practices**:
  - Group related notes spatially
  - Use zoom for overview or detail work
  - Minimap helps navigate large canvas

- **AI Best Practices**:
  - Select specific text for better results
  - Use Expand for bullet points ‚Üí paragraphs
  - Use Summarize for long notes
  - Use Improve for rough drafts

- **Search Tips**:
  - Type partial words (fuzzy matching)
  - Use date filters to narrow results
  - Search both titles and content

---

## üìù Development Notes

### State Management:
- React hooks for local component state
- IndexedDB for persistent storage
- Dexie's `useLiveQuery` for reactive updates

### Styling Approach:
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Dark mode support throughout
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Type Safety:
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Custom types for Chrome AI APIs
- Strict null checks enabled
